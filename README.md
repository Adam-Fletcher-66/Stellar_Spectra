# Stellar_Spectra

This project analyzes the scientific spectral data taken for one star from each of the respective stellar spectral types: O,B,A,F,G,K,M.
The purpose of this project is to measure the absorption lines of stellar atmospheres to learn their elemental composition and to also plot their blackbody spectra to observe how the temperature changes with wavelength.
